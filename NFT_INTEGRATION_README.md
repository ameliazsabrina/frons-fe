- **Proof of Authorship**: NFTs provide immutable proof of authorship on the blockchain
- **Revenue Sharing**: Built-in royalty system for future citations and usage

### For Readers

- **NFT Verification**: View NFT metadata and verify publication authenticity
- **Blockchain Explorer**: Direct links to view NFTs on Solana Explorer
- **IPFS Access**: Permanent access to manuscript content via IPFS
